We have taken measures to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and lawfully, and that it will receive an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.

## SECURITY OF YOUR DATA

In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are taking appropriate security and technical measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, misuse or alteration.\

## CHILDREN
Our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or the applicable age by local law) and we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from or direct or target interest based advertising to users under the minimum legal age.

If a player indicates they are underage, we will limit their access to certain features, such as chat and social media features.

If you are parent or guardian and believe that we might have any data from or about your child under the age, you may contact us as describe above.
If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal data contrary to the above, we will delete any personal data we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account.
